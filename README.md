# flow

flow is a command line tool that links a few things I continuously happen to do in my every day life as a mobile developer.

It's based on the Atlassian stack (stash & JIRA server) and makes a few assumptions about

* workflows,
* existing JIRA issue types,
* (branch) naming conventions,
* the URLs of stash & JIRA (as subdomains of 'company.com', which is retrieved from 'git remote -v')
* the login is global and not based on the repo for example
* and probably a few things moreâ€¦

flow is also a playground for me to try out things in Swift, the Swift Package Manager and in general to learn about new things I come across while implementing new features.

## Running it
flow requires macOS 10.2 with Swift 5 installed. The following will clone the repo, build the executable and create a symbolic link from your binaries folder to the executable:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sebastianpixel/flow.git \
&& cd flow \
&& swift build -c release \
&& ln -s `pwd`/.build/release/flow /usr/local/bin/flow
```

## Commands
### Start working on an issue
`flow init <options>` will

* create a branch based on your selection from the last updated issues and their sub-tasks in the format `<issuetype>-<PROJECT>-<number>-<train-cased-issue-title>`,
* push the branch upstream,
* assign the JIRA issue to you and
* update its status to `In Progress`.

### Track To-Dos
Add, edit, complete, delete to-do items with `flow todo` relative to the current repo, branch or without such constraint (based on iCloud reminders).

### Create a PR
Use `flow pr <options>` to

* write the PR description in the editor specified in your global git config,
* select a destination branch (or just use the branch of the parent issue),
* assign the PR to reviewers (or pick the default reviewers of the repo) and
* update the JIRA issue to `Ready To Review`.
* `flow pr -m` finally merges the pull request and
* shows a list of status for the issue to select from.
